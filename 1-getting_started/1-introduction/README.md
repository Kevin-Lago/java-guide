# Introduction

## History of Java

- Java was originally named Greentalk. It was created by James Gosling and his team, Green Team, in 1991 at Sun Microsystems.

- Greentalk was then changed to Oak and finally Java in 1995.

- In 2006 Java was made open sourced by Sun Microsystems.

- In 2010 Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems. Oracle split Java and named the open sourced version OpenJDK, and their own as OracleJDK.

## Java

- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.

- Java's strength is it can be run on any machine with a JVM. Implementing a concept known as [Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere)

## JRE, JVM and JDK

- The Java Runtime Environment or [JRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)#Java_Runtime_Environment) basically runs Java programs.

- The Java Virtual Machine or [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) is a virtual machine that enables computers to run Java-Bytecode.

- Unlike other languages, Java is first converted into Java-Bytecode before being converted into Machine-Code by the JVM. Because of this Java can run on anything that has a JVM.

- The Java Development Kit or [JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) is essentially a set of tools to create Java applications.

## OracleJDK vs OpenJDK

- OracleJDK is commercially supported, released and distributed by Oracle with an [Oracle Technology Network (OTN) Licesnse](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/sqldev-license.html).

- Oracle provides Long Time Support (LTS) for their JDK. You can view this here [Java SE Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html)

- OracleJDK includes some features which may not be present in the OpenJDK versions such as [Java Flight Recorder (JFR)](https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170).

- OpenJDK is community supported and has a [General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

- There are many [derivatives of OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK#OpenJDK_builds) such as:

    - AdoptOpenJDK
    - Amazon Corretto
    - SAP SapMachine

## Java Enterprise Edition

- The [Enterprise Edition](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html) (Java EE) of Java is an extension to the Standard Edition (Java SE).

- The Java Enterprise Editions began with J2EE. Then changed to Java EE and finally [Jakarta EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE)

- The Enterprise Editions of Java provide tools to create enterprise level applications such as:

    - [Jakarta Servlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet)

    - [Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_RESTful_Web_Services)

    - [Java Persistence (JPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Persistence)

## Java Frameworks

- [Java Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_frameworks) provide more tools to create applications. For example:

	- GeoTools

	- Mockito

	- JUnit

	- Thymeleaf
